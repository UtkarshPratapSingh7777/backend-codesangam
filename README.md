# 🐪 The Caravan Chronicle  

A grievance redressal & city management platform designed for the **Circus of Wonders**, a traveling mobile city with performers, vendors, and roadies.  

As the circus travels, infrastructure issues (like road damage, water leakage, and garbage pile-ups) often arise. Citizens can use **The Caravan Chronicle** to report problems, track resolutions, and ensure their temporary city runs as smoothly as the show itself.
